# Data-Analysis
Exploring data with NumPy and Pandas.
This is a simple project where a professor takes data of students study hours and the grades they achievied and do data analysis using pandas and numpy
after analysis we seperate students who passed and failed by considering passing grade greater than or equal to 60 and arrange the data in descending order
Also performing operations where students not attended the exam and no grade is given i.e., dealing with null values in the data
and also calculating average number of students studying hours of students who passed and students who failed to get better understanding of number of studying hours required for students to pass and for professor to guide students accordingly.
