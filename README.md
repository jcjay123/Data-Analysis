# Data-Analysis
Exploring data with NumPy and Pandas.
This is a simple project where a professor takes data of students study hours and the grades they achievied and do data analysis using pandas and numpy
after analysis we seperate students who passed and failed by considering passing grade greater than or equal to 60 and arrange the data in descending order
Also performing operations where students not attended the exam so no grade is given i.e., dealing with null values in the data
